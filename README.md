HTML CSS Git Challenge: Code Refactor

In this project, I reviewed the HTML and the CSS provided and applied best practices to make the code cleaner and more accessible. 

I leverated semantic HTML elements and ensured the code is presented in a logical, easy to read structure. I made the nav URLs jump to their corresponding sections. I added empty alt tags for images since, after careful thought, I believe all the images on this page are decorative. This includes the background image - I did a significant amount of research to conclude that it's ok that this asset is in the CSS vs. in the HTML with an alt tag. I also checked back in the run buddy module where we added the background image and it was done the same in that project as it is here. 

I re-organized the CSS to display global, element, class, and ID selectors in easy to identify groups. I removed redundant CSS and re-wrote a couple of things that seemingly could be problemantic when building on this project (for example, I changed the float classes to be IDs specific to the images they apply to). 

Overall, I am confident that the HTML and CSS for this project is now significantly more accessible and cleaner and meets the acceptance criteria.
